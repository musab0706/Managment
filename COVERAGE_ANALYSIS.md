## 📊 **COVERAGE STATISTICS**

### What I Have:
- ✅ **21 courses** with full weekly data
- ✅ Covers **first 1-2 years** of engineering
- ✅ All core math, physics, chemistry basics

### What's Missing:
- ❌ **~150+ courses** needed for complete coverage
- ❌ All **3rd and 4th year** specialized courses
- ❌ All **biology/biochemistry** courses
- ❌ Most **upper-level CIS** courses
- ❌ Advanced **MATH** courses
- ❌ **Environmental sciences** courses
- ❌ **Complementary studies** courses

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

### Short Term (What Works Now):
The 21 courses I have cover:
- ✅ **First year of ALL engineering programs** (Fall & Winter)
- ✅ **Most of second year** core courses
- ✅ **~40-50% of total engineering requirements**

### What You Should Do:

**Option 1: Use What I Have (Quick Solution)**
- Start with the 21 courses I've completed
- They cover first 2 years reasonably well
- Students can manually add 3rd/4th year courses as simple cards
- System still provides value for early years

**Option 2: Gradual Expansion (Recommended)**
- Deploy with current 21 courses
- I can add more courses incrementally:
  - Next: Add remaining 2nd year ENGG courses (5-10 courses)
  - Then: Add 3rd year ENGG courses (20-30 courses)
  - Then: Add 4th year ENGG courses (20-30 courses)
  - Then: Add biology/biochemistry courses
  - Then: Add remaining CIS, MATH, etc.

**Option 3: Priority Courses**
Tell me which specific major you want to focus on first (e.g., Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering) and I'll add ALL courses for that major completely.

## 💡 **CURRENT STATUS**

### ✅ Fully Supported (1st-2nd Year):
- **Mechanical Engineering** - Semesters 1-4 (~80% covered)
- **Computer Engineering** - Semesters 1-4 (~70% covered)
- **Civil Engineering** - Semesters 1-3 (~60% covered)
- **All Engineering Programs** - First year basics

### ⚠️ Partially Supported (Missing 3rd-4th Year):
- **All majors** - Need 3rd and 4th year courses
- **Biomedical Engineering** - Missing biology courses
- **Biological Engineering** - Missing biology/biochem courses
- **Environmental Engineering** - Missing environmental science courses

### ❌ Not Supported Yet:
- Biology-heavy programs (need BIOL, BIOC, etc.)
- Advanced CIS courses for Computer Engineering
- Advanced MATH courses for Applied Math
- Complementary studies courses

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS?**

Would you like me to:
1. **Add more courses now** - Tell me which major/year to prioritize
2. **Focus on one major** - Complete ALL courses for one specific major
3. **Continue with 2nd year** - Add remaining ENGG*2000 level courses
4. **Add upper years** - Add ENGG*3000 and ENGG*4000 level courses

Let me know which direction you want to go! 🎓
